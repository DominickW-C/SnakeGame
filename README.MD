Snake game made over winter break of sophmore year to familiarize myself with typescript.
could use some cleaning up to be made more efficient, but I feel I got what I want out of this project.

GAME NOTES: 
  - moving is a little weird, I wanted it to be so when you hit an arrow you would instantly move then it will 
    resart the counter to move again, I think I got it working all right but there are sometimes you can notices 
    what feels like a small jump
  - I did not want to adds graphics or make it look pretty

all config stuff was provided by Vite, along with a the first ~90 ish lines of the CSS. 

feels wrong if I don't mention that adding HTML in JS/TS was something I got from Google AI
for the game over screen. Also used W3 schools, some random google searches, and my tetris game for some help 
with how to use certain methods and built in functions. besides these small things, rest was done by me. 

Do I need to cite personal projects? Do I need to cite every google search I do? probably not. 
Especially since I think they were for very small things. 

Will anyone every read this? Probably not.

biggest mistake was doing this with Vite, I feel like I can get rid of half the stuff
it downloads but when I do it completely breaks.
